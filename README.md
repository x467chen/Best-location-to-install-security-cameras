## Synopsis

This project has implement several algorithm to find the best location to install the security cameras based on some special requirements. All the algorithm are wrote by language C, but the map generator, which can read, fix and manage the map is wrote by Python.


## Motivation

1.To create a small programming which can read and create road and use algorithm to find the best place to install the security camera. <br>
2.Write a driver program in C that, using Inter-Process Communication (IPC), and create a small random road infomation input generator in C. Links the output of the random input generator to the input of the Python script, and another one to modify the output format of the Map-Generator Python script to match the input format of my C program.<br>
3.Implement four different algorithm: BFS, CNF-SAT, APPROX-VC-1 and APPROX-VC-2 to compare the result from them.<br>
